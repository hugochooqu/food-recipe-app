 2. Calories counter to calculate the total calories from each recipe
 3. An exchange converter that converts the total cost from naira to USD
 4. A modal showing the full details of the recipe, ingredients, as well as instructions
 5. A dedicated page that fetches and displays restaurants around you. (So do well to allow the site to access your location)
